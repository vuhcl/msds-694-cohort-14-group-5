1298-gorillaz-plastic-beach,Prefix,Craig Jenkins,"He never panders to them; instead, Plastic Beach‘s guest vocals are anchored by Albarn’s own melodic flair. His falsettoed ennui shines through, and the songs are loaded with Albarn’s pet sounds.",29 Sep 2018 17:24:44 GMT,85

1298-gorillaz-plastic-beach,God Is in the TV,Oli Shilling,"Track by track, this album works brilliantly, with most songs successfully employing guest stars.

1298-gorillaz-plastic-beach,Drowned in Sound,Wendy Roby,"Because past the pop songs, past the soaring (and let’s not make any bones about it, this album soars in places) this is a supremely clever album.

1298-gorillaz-plastic-beach,NOW Magazine,Richard Trapunski,"One might think the project would crumble under its own weight, but after a few listens it melds into a consistent parcel of didactic, retro/futuristic synth-pop ... It shouldn’t work, but it really does.",22 Jan 2016 17:25:24 GMT,80

1298-gorillaz-plastic-beach,AllMusic,Stephen Thomas Erlewine,"Plastic Beach is the first Gorillaz album to play like a soundtrack to a cartoon -- which isn’t entirely a bad thing, because as Albarn grows as a composer, he’s a master of subtly shifting moods and intricately threaded allusions, often creating richly detailed collages that are miniature marvels.",29 Apr 2011 15:05:03 GMT,80
1298-gorillaz-plastic-beach,Tiny Mix Tapes,B McGhee,"Albarn doesn’t give us a “Clint Eastwood” or a “Dare” this time around, but in spite of a messy and patently artificial conceptual framework, Plastic Beach feels clean, shiny, and new.",29 Apr 2011 15:04:36 GMT,80
1298-gorillaz-plastic-beach,Entertainment Weekly,Leah Greenblatt,"Like its name, Plastic Beach has a sharp tang of cognitive dissonance — its songs sound like dispatches from a crew of hip-kid astronauts, unmoored in some space-dust ether ...

1298-gorillaz-plastic-beach,Rolling Stone,Rob Sheffield,"Plastic Beach, Gorillaz's third excellent album in a row, is all Albarn — he writes the tunes, produces, sings, plays most of the music and gets people on the phone for left-field cameos.",31 Aug 2014 11:34:41 GMT,70
1298-gorillaz-plastic-beach,DIY,Lawrence Vaughan,"Of the sixteen tracks at least seven are filler and with repeat performances, ‘Plastic Beach’ does feel a tad recycled towards the end; more Blackpool than Hawaii, it’s still an album full of brilliance from a bona fide British genius.",19 Jun 2015 01:24:33 GMT,70

1526-lcd-soundsystem-this-is-happening,Paste,Rachael Maddux,"Murphy and his crew are fully committed to this album.

1526-lcd-soundsystem-this-is-happening,Pitchfork,Ryan Dombal,"Even considering his bold-name touchstones for This Is Happening, it would be shortsighted to cry rip-off; Murphy is remaking essential 70s art-rock in his own hyper-modern, self-aware image.",29 Apr 2011 14:44:14 GMT,92
1526-lcd-soundsystem-this-is-happening,musicOMH,Andrew Burgess,"This Is Happening suffers no shortage of really great songs.

(Where else does one go after producing Neon Bible, one of the decade’s more somber statements on existence?) But far from a comforting escape from all that came before, Arcade Fire’s suburbia is a lot like Cheever’s: menacing, shadowing the depression of lost innocence and the paranoia of adulthood behind a pretty white picket fence.",29 Apr 2011 15:04:36 GMT,80

1964-katy-perry-teenage-dream,Drowned in Sound,David Pott-Negrine,"The most interesting thing here is the lyrics. Taken out of context, they’re not wholly remarkable and say little more then the typical lyric fodder of aren’t boys great, aren’t boys dumb, I like drinking in clubs, yadda yadda yadda. But when you put them in context with Katy Perry the popstar it becomes obvious that half of the songs were written before she became Mrs Russell Brand, and so more than likely deal with her break-up with that ball bag from the musical abomination Gym Class Heroes, and the other half are all about her new relationship with the guy who decided it would be a good idea to go to work dressed as Osama Bin Laden on the day after the September 11th terror attacks.",29 Apr 2011 14:50:51 GMT,40

2111-oneohtrix-point-never-returnal,Beats Per Minute,Ryan Jordal,"Returnal is a cinematic, flowing story. It will scare you, soothe you, and will cause your mind to create its own visual landscape.

Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga, from 2007, saw Spoon reach their apex in this regard; a record where auditory adventurousness (see 'The Ghost of You

Lingers') and pop nous ('The Underdog') not only sat comfortably side by side, but where the former actually served the needs of the latter, as on the modernised Motown of 'You Got Yr. Cherry Bomb'.",29 Apr 2011 14:50:51 GMT,80

1063-owen-pallett-heartland,Pitchfork,Nitsuh Abebe,"If you're lucky, you might already know this guy as Final Fantasy. His reasons for dropping that name are probably boring and copyright-related, but still: The name change seems healthy on whole other extra-legal levels. I've never known anyone not to be wowed by Final Fantasy's live show, and Final Fantasy's live show is just Owen Pallett: the guy himself, a violin, and a loop pedal. It's about as solo as anything gets-- a performance, not a project. Stepping out under his own name feels like an acknowledgement of this, as if Pallett's ready to cast aside the modesty of having a ""project""-- it's just this thing I've been working on-- and present himself, fully upright, as an artist.",29 Apr 2011 14:44:14 GMT,86

1063-owen-pallett-heartland,Drowned in Sound,Andrzej Lukowski,"With hindsight, the demise of Final Fantasy was entirely predictable. Sure, the official cause of death was some mumbled notice about wanting to avoid confusion when Heartland became the first FF release to hit Japan, lest the locals start using copies as chocobo lures. But really, in recent years the name of the string arranger Owen Pallett has become vastly more recognisable than his recording artist alias. Extraordinarily graceful and full bodied the looped solo string arrangements on He Poos Clouds may have been, but Final Fantasy’s second album was still an intimate, oddball work, with everything besides the strings muffled, distant and shrill, strange, dissonant tales of childhood crushes on the dude out of Zelda punctuated by bangs and silence.",29 Apr 2011 14:50:51 GMT,80

Once something is defined, it's doomed. While it's tempting to throw around terms like this, they ultimately feel disingenuous and exclusionary. Sadly its the critics' terminal plight to try to define movements, therefore containing them, suffocating them. Maybe in this specific context, I should leave the problem of defining Emeralds' sound to my iTunes; the genre tag it gave to Does It Look Like I'm Here? was simply ""data.""",29 Apr 2011 15:04:36 GMT,80

1788-of-montreal-false-priest,musicOMH,,"Of Montreal's 2007 album, Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer?, is one of the best 'breakdown' albums ever. In a reversal of most artistic endeavours, the more self-indulgent and navel-gazing singer-songwriter Kevin Barnes' writing became, the more inclusive and enjoyable the album proved as a listening experience. The follow-up, 2008's Skeletal Lamping, took the funky rhythms and sex-fixated lyrics of Hissing Fauna and screwed them up into a knotty, continuous song cycle. It proved mostly successful, although even Skeletal Lamping's most avid fans are unlikely to listen to it regularly.",29 Apr 2011 15:04:45 GMT,60

The music had leaked by that point, so that's pretty much an endorsement... However, that wasn't the end, as you are surely aware. The record has been given extra poignancy by the tragic loss of Mark Linkous by a shot to the heart (not that this is his last hurrah – the final Sparklehorse album was all but finished, and will presumably emerge at some future point).

1880-bombay-bicycle-club-flaws,PopMatters,,"Named after a bourgeois curry franchise, Bombay Bicycle Club made quite a stir a few years ago with EPs The Boy I Used to Be and How We Are. These records issued the band’s signature sound, and were as creamy white and tempered as those restaurants’ interiors. There was a politeness to them, perhaps a lack of bite. It turns out that this has been the band’s staple ever since, but there was also a restless creativity to those EPs that helped to push them to the top of the UK Indie Charts.",29 Apr 2011 15:04:54 GMT,60

It was that unswerving balance between a majestic tunefulness – theirs in particular articulated by a nous for classical music – and a cutting edginess that made Ratatat something of a precursor to the likes of Digitalism and Justice. Moreover, tracks like “Lex” and “Seventeen Years”, where pearlescent guitar hooks beamed in surprising comfort with Bach-like curlicues showed us that the Brooklyn duo could play Daft Punk at their own game, and then some.",29 Apr 2011 15:04:54 GMT,90

This is due in no small part to the members’ endless side projects; as of press time, Spencer Krug has officially been in every single indie band in Canada. I always half-expect each new record to be the one where they decide, “Fuck it, let’s just do our own thing from now on.” But mostly it’s because the individual members explore so much unique terrain on their own that I’m always anxious to hear what they bring back to the collective. Those who have been following them all along probably won’t find anything too shocking their third time around, however, as Expo 86 seems to refine rather than reinvent the sound of their guitar-driven predecessor, 2007’s At Mount Zoomer.",29 Apr 2011 15:04:36 GMT,80

Between Spencer Krug, Dan Boeckner, and Dante DeCaro, I count half-a-dozen notable bands past or present, and drummer Arlen Thompson has put in work with Arcade Fire.

Produced by Isaac Brock, the album was often compared to his records with Modest Mouse, but in retrospect there was something much more subtle, much more in control about Wolf Parade then.

Though only single ""Jail La La"" (the would-be LP's title) deals with actually being imprisoned, it's an oddly appropriate fit for the Dum Dum Girls' aesthetic: leather, cherry red lipstick, a classic girl-group sound that nods to drag races as much as malt shops. Because of an image licensing snafu, the original concept

Back then, their chances of living beyond the next Hype Machine cycle was anyone's guess, and any notions of longevity seemed moot for a band that preferred to wrap things up around the two-minute mark. But as other 2006 indie upstarts like Annuals, Be Your Own Pet, and Voxtrot have blown up or faded away, Tokyo Police Club endure. This is not a coincidence.",29 Apr 2011 14:44:14 GMT,76

1593-menomena-mines,Pitchfork,Joe Tangari,"I have to give Menomena credit. When they emerged, they built all their songs using their own software. The approach worked really well, resulting in a wildly creative debut LP, I Am the Fun Blame Monster. But the band refused to let the process become the point, and seven years later, on their third album (not counting Under an Hour), you have to listen carefully to even detect the modular, mix-and-match method the band still employs in the studio. Mines, more than any of their previous work, really sounds like the trio did as much conventional songwriting as jamming, looping, and editing.",29 Apr 2011 14:44:14 GMT,82
1593-menomena-mines,Drowned in Sound,Robert Cooke,"Four albums in, and Menomena are still making music on Deeler – a software programme that band member Brent Knopf wrote and submitted for his college coursework. Now, there’s nothing wrong with sticking to a tried and tested method in itself, because it’s handy to know what you’re working with before you get started on a project. But in the cutthroat world of artrock, don’t bands at this stage in their career need to force themselves out of their comfort zone a little, or risk getting too settled in the same familiar territory they’ve spent the last decade exploring?",29 Apr 2011 14:50:51 GMT,80

1911-matthew-dear-black-city,Pitchfork,Joe Colly,"If you've followed Matthew Dear over the years, then you know he doesn't like to stay in one place for very long. Even as a primarily electronic artist in the early 2000s, Dear hopped from label to label, switched aliases often, and made everything from steely microhouse to harder Detroit techno. But his biggest departure was 2007's Asa Breed, the record where he stepped out from behind the decks and reached for the mic. Singing on tracks and leaning more heavily on song structure, he built strange hybrid music that had one foot in techno and the other in pop.",29 Apr 2011 14:44:14 GMT,84

1911-matthew-dear-black-city,PopMatters,Benjamin Aspray,"A young woman, her milk chocolate skin adorned in exotic, silky fabrics, bellydances against a clear blue sky. Too blue, really. As if the color was oversaturated in a video lab. And of course it is; her green-screened levitation is about as convincing as the Blue’s Clues. For some reason, though, that doesn’t seem to matter. Something about that infectious smile, held by a bold pair of cheekbones like the chain that links her nose to her ear, compels us to stop caring, and follow her, as she leaps across rooftops, flies over rice patties and visits the Seven Wonders of the World. Besides, why worry about realism when it’s all over in three minutes anyway?",29 Apr 2011 15:04:54 GMT,80
1911-matthew-dear-black-city,musicOMH,Daniel Paton,"Descriptions of Matthew Dear as a DJ or a dance music producer only partially prepare for the sheer weirdness of Black City. As might be expected, Dear is clearly something of a nocturnalist, fascinated by darkness. But Black City enters a stranger, more disorientating world than 2007's Asa Breed, where Dear constructed a gauzy, romantic modern disco sound. Black City is a sleek but murky creation that owes a notable debt to the more questing and imaginative music of the early '80s. Dear's tempos here are mostly slow, never rising above moderate, and the result is an anxious but exhilarating journey through the night.",29 Apr 2011 15:04:45 GMT,80

1911-matthew-dear-black-city,Tiny Mix Tapes,Jay Hill,"For most of the last decade, Matthew Dear eluded easy categorization by constantly morphing between his various alter egos. He spent time working as False, a relatively straightforward representation focused on the producer’s allegiance to Detroit techno, followed by the whimsical Jabberjaw and the obtuse Audion. But since 2003’s Leave Luck to Heaven, his best efforts have appeared under his own name. Shifting from the pedantic Audion moniker used on last year’s It’s Full of Blinding Light EP, Dear returns to the wide-open emotional resonance that transformed 2007’s Asa Breed into one of the truly iconographic releases in any of the various techno subgenres.",29 Apr 2011 15:04:36 GMT,70
